# 📌 Vector Operations with Python – Linear Algebra Essentials

Welcome to this notebook!  
This repository contains my detailed hands-on work on **Vector Operations**, which is a crucial part of **Linear Algebra for Machine Learning**.

## 📚 **About This Project**

This Jupyter Notebook:
- Explains what **vectors** are.
- Demonstrates **basic vector operations**: addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and dot product.
- Visualizes how vectors behave in 2D space.
- Shows how vector **magnitude (norm)** and **direction (angle)** are calculated.
- Connects these concepts to practical **machine learning applications**.

## 🧩 **Key Concepts Covered**

- ✅ **What is a Vector?**
  - Vectors as 1-D arrays.
  - Vectors in 2D and 3D.
- ✅ **Vector Magnitude (Norm)**
  - L1-norm (Taxicab distance).
  - L2-norm (Euclidean distance).
- ✅ **Vector Addition & Subtraction**
  - Component-wise operations.
  - Geometric interpretation using parallelogram.
- ✅ **Scalar Multiplication**
  - Stretching or flipping a vector.
- ✅ **Dot Product**
  - Dot product as projection.
  - How dot product reveals the angle between vectors.
  - Perpendicular (orthogonal) vectors.
- ✅ **Practical use cases**
  - How distances & similarity are used in ML.

## 🚀 **Why Does This Matter?**

Understanding vectors is **foundational** for:
- Machine learning models.
- Optimizing algorithms like **Gradient Descent**.
- Data transformations.
- Computer graphics, physics simulations, and more.
